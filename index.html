## Today I don't talk about...
* Principle of TDD
* How important test is!
* Something like that

---

## Today I talk about...
* Why do I write test?
* Process of contributing
* Points of writing test of OSS

---

## I write test just because I like test :)

---

## OK

---

## An example Open Source Software is...

---

## mastodon
![mastodon](./img/mastodon.jpeg)

---

## One day, I found a spec file...

---

![fetch_atom_spec](./img/fetch_atom_spec.png)

---

## Great

---

## But wait,

---

### There are a lot of rules in testing world
* TDD
  - should test all of methods
* BDD
  - should test behavior
* Test only provided public methods
  - included in BDD?

---

## What is the policy of mastodon?

---

# ðŸ¤”

---

## Let's send a Pull Request!

---

![first-pr](./img/first-pr.png)

---

## What is the point?
* Write test just about 1 method
  - Committers can see PR easily
* Write private methods's test
  - I can find out their testing style explicitly

---

## Let's see their reactions...ðŸ‘€

---

![first-pr-result](./img/first-pr-result.png)

---

## Looks my PR perfectðŸ˜‡

---

## OK, so let's go ahead!

---

![pr-second](./img/pr-second.png)

---

* There is no immediate harm in these tests but you should know that unit tests should not try to look into private methods or internal variables.
* The unit test must confirm the public API of the class works, i.e. how other code will use it.
* The internal implementation of the class is subject to change (refactoring).
* The perfect refactoring is when you change the code but don't have to touch the tests.
* With tests like these, they would also have to be modified if the internal implementation changes in the future.

---

## Finally, I could get usable information from the author.
* PR has already been merged, but don't mind :)

---

## I completely understand about it

---

![pr-third](./img/pr-third.png)

---

![pr-third-result](./img/pr-third-result.png)

---

## Looks Good To Me :)

---

## Sample PRs
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/6439
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/6446
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/6455
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/6456
* https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/6500

---

## Conclusion
* Well-known OSS needs test
* Communication with committers is the most important
* Make simple, understandable PR
* Enjoy testing

---

### Please introduce me the OSS needs test :)
